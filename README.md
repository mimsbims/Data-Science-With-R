## Get Started With GitHub

The Hello World Exercise: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)

### Steps

1. **Create a repository** with a README file.
2. **Create a branch** off your main branch. A branch is a copy of main at the time the branch is made. Edits can be done to the branch and when the edits are complete, the branch can be merged into main. Name the new branch readme_edits
3. **Make and commit changes** to the README.md file in the readme_edits branch. Use various Markdown elements (see cheatsheet link above).
4. **Open a pull request.** This means: you propose your changes and request that someone review them and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

### Pull request

1. Under **Pull requests tab** of your repository, click **New pull request**.
2. In the Example Comparisons Box, select the branch with the edits you want to review and merge. Review the changes. Click **Create pull request**. Collaborators can now review edits and make suggestions.
3. **Merge pull request**.
4. **Delete branch**.
